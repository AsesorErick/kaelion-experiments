# EXPERIMENT 2: BEC ANALOG BLACK HOLE
# ============================================================
# Kaelion Project - Protocol for BEC verification
# Author: Erick Francisco Perez Eugenio
# Status: PROTOCOL READY - NOT YET EXECUTED
# ============================================================
# 
# This experiment requires collaboration with an experimental
# group that has access to BEC (Bose-Einstein Condensate) systems
# capable of creating sonic black hole analogs.
#
# Potential collaborators:
# - Jeff Steinhauer (Technion) - Hawking radiation in BEC
# - Silke Weinfurtner (Nottingham) - Analog gravity
#
# The protocol measures Hawking radiation spectrum in a BEC
# sonic black hole and extracts α from the logarithmic corrections
# to the entanglement entropy.
#
# If α follows Kaelion prediction α = -0.5 - λ in a completely
# different physical system (cold atoms vs superconducting qubits),
# this would be strong evidence for universality.
