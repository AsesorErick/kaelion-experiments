# EXPERIMENT 3: ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATIONS
# ============================================================
# Kaelion Project - Future protocol for astrophysical verification
# Author: Erick Francisco Perez Eugenio
# Status: FUTURE PROTOCOL
# ============================================================
#
# This experiment would require:
# - High-precision measurements of black hole thermodynamics
# - Data from gravitational wave observations (LIGO/Virgo)
# - X-ray observations of black hole accretion disks
#
# The goal would be to extract the logarithmic correction
# coefficient α from real astrophysical black holes and compare
# with Kaelion predictions.
#
# This is a long-term goal requiring significant advances in
# observational capabilities.
