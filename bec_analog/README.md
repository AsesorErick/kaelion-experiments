# BEC Analog Black Hole Experiment

## Measuring λ via Acoustic Hawking Radiation

**Status:** 📋 Protocol Ready - Awaiting Lab Collaboration

---

## Overview

Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) can create "acoustic black holes" - regions where the flow velocity exceeds the speed of sound. These analog systems exhibit Hawking-like radiation and provide a controllable platform for testing quantum gravity predictions.

---

## Kaelion Prediction

The entropy of the acoustic horizon should follow:

```
S = A/4 + α(λ) log(A) + O(1)
```

where:
- A = horizon "area" (circumference in 1D systems)
- α(λ) = -0.5 - λ
- λ depends on BEC interaction strength

**Expected Results:**
| BEC Regime | Interaction | λ | α | Interpretation |
|------------|-------------|---|---|----------------|
| Weakly interacting | na³ << 1 | 0.0 - 0.3 | -0.8 to -0.5 | LQG-like |
| Strongly interacting | na³ ~ 1 | 0.7 - 1.0 | -1.5 to -1.2 | Holographic-like |

## Protocol Summary

1. Prepare elongated BEC (Rb-87, ~10⁵ atoms)
2. Create supersonic flow using moving potential
3. Establish stable acoustic horizon
4. Measure density-density correlations G(x₁, x₂)
5. Extract entropy from correlation structure
6. Fit S(A) = A/4 + α log(A) to extract α
7. Compute λ = -0.5 - α
8. Verify α = -0.5 - λ (self-consistency)
